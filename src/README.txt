Rose Crypt - a tool to encrypt/decrypt a file using AES
  
Description
===========
 
Rose Crypt provides users with a simplistic application that can be used
for encrypting files in your computer using a custom passphrase.
 
With its minimal design, Rose Crypt can be used by both advanced and beginner users.
Once the encryption process is finished, you can access the newly created file
from the location you previously selected.
